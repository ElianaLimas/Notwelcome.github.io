<br><br>
<p> The University of Perpetual Help System DALTA celebrated on September 4, since it was not possible to celebrate on the exact date; September 8. The Catholic Church too celebrates the birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God! This feast day is celebrated exactly nine months after the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception on December 8. Much effort was exerted when it came to designing the classroom, making it homely and welcoming. </p>
<br><br>
<h3> THE BLESSED MASS OF THE HOLY MOTHER </h3>

<br><br>
<p> The Mass of the Holy Mother was celebrated in order to honor the Blessed Virgin Mary. The preaching was notably fiery and passionate, and holy water was soon sprinkled on the heads of Perpetualites alike. All of Charity participated by reflecting on their actions and listening intently. </p>
<br><br>
<h3> THE BLESSED MASS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT </h3>

<br><br>
<p> The Mass of the Holy Spirit proved to be a mean to encourage divine intervention in the lives of all of the students. This was to show reverence to the Lord most High and to the Holy Spirit that continues to guide each believer through trying times. </p>
<br><br>
<h3> THE MATHSCI-YA WEEK </h3>
